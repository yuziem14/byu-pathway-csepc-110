# Project 01: Clever Stories
Overview
Mad Libs are a type of funny story, where a person is asked for words without knowing their context. The words are then placed into a story in a pre-determined format, often resulting in funny statements.

For example, consider prompts for:

Plural noun

Adjective

Noun

And a story, such as:

Then the story would read:

When it comes to ducks, you would never want to jump, especially if you encountered a cold taco.
